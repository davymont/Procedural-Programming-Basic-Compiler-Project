# README
 
This was my first piece of coursework after 2 months of Java!
We had to create a basic compiler called 'weeJava', with .txt file test cases.
weeJava had to take lines of code and break every character down and determine what it was and what to do with it.

<u> Instructions to use: </u>

Open in your favourite Java IDE

Run Q5.java file

Watch the magic happen
